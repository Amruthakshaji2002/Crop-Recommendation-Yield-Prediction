# 🌾 Crop Recommendation and Yield Prediction  

A machine learning project to recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation and predict yield based on soil and climatic conditions.  
This project supports farmers in making informed decisions for sustainable agriculture.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
Agriculture forms the backbone of food security and the economy. Farmers face challenges in choosing the right crop and estimating yield due to changing weather, soil conditions, and rainfall.  
This project applies **classification and regression models** to recommend crops and predict yield.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Recommend the best crop based on soil and climate parameters.  
- Predict expected yield for selected crops.  
- Provide a decision-support tool for farmers using machine learning.  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
- Features:  
  - 🌱 Soil nutrients (N, P, K)  
  - 🌡️ Temperature  
  - 💧 Rainfall  
  - 🌍 pH values  
- Outputs:  
  - Crop recommendation (classification)  
  - Yield prediction (regression)  

---

## 🧠 Methodology  
1. Data preprocessing & feature selection  
2. Crop Recommendation (Classification models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)  
3. Yield Prediction (Regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, etc.)  
4. Model evaluation with accuracy, R² score, and error metrics  

---

## 📈 Results  
- ✅ Crop recommendation model achieved high accuracy with Random Forest.  
- ✅ Yield prediction produced reliable results using regression techniques.

## 🔮 Future Scope  
- Integration with real-time weather data APIs.  
- Deployment as a web or mobile app for farmers.  
- Extend dataset to cover more regions and crop varieties.
